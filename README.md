# envImport

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of envImport is to obtain, and make seamlessly useable,
environmental data from disparate data sources, for a geographic area of
interest.

## Installation

You can install the development version of envImport from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("dew-landscapes/envImport")
```

## Supported data sources

`data_name` = ‘data source’. Data sources are (usually) obvious sources
of data. Examples are the Global Biodiversity Infrastructure Facility
([GBIF](https://www.gbif.org/)), Atlas of Living Australia
([ALA](https://www.ala.org.au/)) or Terrestrial Ecosystems Network
([TERN](https://www.tern.org.au/)). There are 18 data sources currently
supported (also see `envImport::data_map`):

- bdbsa: Biological databases of South Australia
- egis: Occurrence datasets from the environmental databases of South
  Australia (e.g. supertables)
- thirdparty: Third party occurrence datasets from the environmental
  databases of South Australia
- herbarium: Australasian Virtual Herbarium (AVH) data from the State
  Herbarium of South Australia (AD)
- havplot: Harmonised Australian Vegetation Plot dataset
- tern: Terrestrial ecosystem network
- abbbs: Australian Bird and Bat Banding Scheme
- alis: Arid lands information system
- bcm: Bushland condition monitoring
- ptp: Paddock tree project
- nvb: DEW Native Vegetation Branch
- other: Other private datasets: SA Bird Atlas (UOA/Birds SA), Birdlife
  Australia Birdata portal, MLR Extra Bandicoot data, KI Post Fire Bird
  Monitoring, SA Seed Conservation Centre
- galah: Atlas of Living Australia
- obis: Ocean Biodiversity Information System
- gbif: Global biodiversity information facility
- verdon: Presence records at 4 ha scale from Simon Verdon’s heath
  mallee bird work
- bruvs: Baited underwater video survey
- samdb_vert: Vertebrate records in the South Australian Murray-Darling
  Basin
- seed: SA Seed Conservation Centre

Five of these sources are publicly available (GBIF, ALA, OBIS, HAVPlot
and TERN).

## General workflow

### `data_map`

The data_map (see table below) provides a mapping from original data
sources to the desired columns in the assembled data set.

Data map of desired columns in the assembled data (col) and names of
columns in the original data. Where a column name from the original data
source does not match columns in the original data source, the get_x
function has usually created a new column to better meet the
requirements of the final combined data set

### `get_x`

`get_x` functions get data from the data source `x`. Results are always
saved to disk (as getting data can be slow). When run again, they load
from the saved file by default. If available, `get_x` functions use any
R packages and functions provided by the data source (e.g. TERN provides
`ausplotsR` \[@R-ausplotsR\]). The first arguments to `get_x` functions
are always:

- `aoi`: an area of interest, provided as simple feature (see
  `sf::sf()`)
- `save_dir`: a directory to save the results to. The default (`NULL`)
  leads to the file `here::here("out", "ds", "x.rds")` being created and
  used as `save_file`. `ds` is for ‘data source’. While the saved file
  is usually `x.rds`, in some instances it follows the format and naming
  of the download from `x` (e.g. GBIF data comes in a `.zip` file named
  by the corresponding download key)
- `get_new`: an override to force `get_x` to requery the data source,
  even if save_file already exists
- `...`: the dots are passed to any underlying ‘native’ function, such
  as `rgbif::occ_download()`, `galah::galah_call()` or
  `ausplotsR::get_ausplots()`

Only the `get_x` functions for publicly available data are available
within envImport.

Within `get_x` functions the following steps are taken:

- query the data source for data within the area of interest
  - possibly including other criteria to limit the results
- adjust the results, if required, to better integrate with other data
  sources
- rename the columns to a common standard (via the data_map)
  - possibly adding some commonly desired fields at this step: `occ` (is
    this a presence \[`1`\] or absence \[`0`\] record?), `month` and
    `year`
- save the results, usually as .parquet

`get_x` functions can be run from `get_data`.

### Combine

No specific functions are provided for combining data. The following are
possible (assuming ‘files’ is a vector of file names resulting from
`get_x`):

- `purrr::map_dfr(files, \(x) rio::import(x, setclass = "tibble")`
- `arrow::open_dataset(files, unify_schema = TRUE) %>% dplyr::collect()`

`rio::import` is possibly more robust to differences in schema when
importing files (based on observation - needs testing).

# Cleaning

`envImport` ***does not clean*** data. Any combined dataset is likely to
contain all sorts of duplication and other spurious records. For help
cleaning data, see, for example:

- The book [Cleaning Biodiversity Data in
  R](https://cleaning-data-r.ala.org.au/)
- R packages:
  - [CoordinateCleaner](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/CoordinateCleaner/vignettes/Cleaning_GBIF_data_with_CoordinateCleaner.html)
  - [envClean](https://dew-landscapes.github.io/envClean/)
